## Objective

Quackodoro was a fun way for me to learn React Native, but I also added my own fun and chaotic twist by introducing a motivating duck that scares you with a knife instead of pom-poms! The duck also reacts to the different break session - during short breaks, it plays games while you rest, and for long breaks, it takes a well-deserved nap. It was a fun idea that challenged me, and the result is an engaging Pomodoro timer that helps you stay focused while being entertained by the duck's antics.

## Technology Learnt
